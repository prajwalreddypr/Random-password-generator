#Random python password generator

A simple and basic password generator that I developed as part of my learnings from the 100 Days of Python challenge (Angela Yu).

#Features

-Takes user input on how many characters do they need from symbols, letters and alphabets

-Based on the user input, it generates 2 kinds of passwords.
1. One with all symbols, letters and alphabets together. (less secure)
2. One with all of them jumbled/randomized (more secure)

-Used random module and all basics of python learnt so far.

#Usage

-Directly run the python script from the command line. It has no user interface.
